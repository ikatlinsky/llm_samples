This project contains example of using langchain capabilities in creation of conversational apps.

This project contains examples for:

- base implementation wiht usage of `ConversationChain`
- usage of external non-parametric knowledge base via `ConversationalRetrievalChain`
- usage of agents to enable multi-agent conversations via `create_conversational_retrieval_agent` using vector store and google search api

NOTE: langchain evolves quickly, some of the code constructs may be deprecated or changed in future versions.
